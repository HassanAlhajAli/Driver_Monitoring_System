    "In Jupyter Notebook, you can create a table of contents with links that allow you to jump to specific cells within the notebook using HTML and anchor tags. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a table of contents with clickable links in a Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",

    "## Subsection 1.1\n",
    "### Sub-subsection 1.1.1\n",
    "Generate Links: Next, generate links to these sections using HTML anchor tags (<a>). You can do this by including the following HTML code block at the beginning or end of your notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "html\n",

    "<a id=\"section-1\"></a>\n",

    "<a id=\"sub-subsection-1-1-1\"></a>\n",
    "Each anchor tag has an id attribute that corresponds to the section header's text, but with spaces replaced by hyphens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the Table of Contents: After generating the anchor tags, you can create the actual table of contents. You can do this using a Markdown cell with links to the sections. Here's an example of a table of contents:\n",

    "markdown\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "## Table of Contents\n",

    "- [Section 1](#section-1)\n",
    "  - [Subsection 1.1](#subsection-1-1)\n",
    "    - [Sub-subsection 1.1.1](#sub-subsection-1-1-1)\n",
    "This Markdown code creates a bullet-pointed list with links that correspond to the anchor tags you created earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clickable Links: Now, when you export or view your Jupyter Notebook, the table of contents will have clickable links that allow you to jump to the respective sections when clicked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a complete example:\n",
    "\n",
    "markdown\n",
